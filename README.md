# The Code

Welcome to **The Code** repository where I'll (probably rarely) be GitBlogging whenever I can. This repository will be used during the different projects i'll be working on, to which links will also be provided. 

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the Prithvi Soma and I'd love to hear about your journey in coding, adventure or wherever your awesome thoughts may lead you! Feel free to hit me up on twiter @heyPerplexeus. If you have any cool projects you want to work on or just throw around ideas, THEN DON'T JEST KEEP IT IN YOUR MIND! GET IN TOUCH! I'd love to see what you have in mind.

For more of me you can look around @

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
